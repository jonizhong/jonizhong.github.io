								<!-- Introtext -->
									<div class="col-md-6 item_introtext">
										<p> I was born and grew up in the third largest city in China, Guangzhou, locating in the southern part. In year 2002, I attended South China University of Technology, which is also in Guangzhou city. There I studied Control Science (major) and Computer Science (minor). </p>


<p>After staying in Harbin Institute of Technology Shenzhen Graudate School for a year, in the year 2007, I got a full postgraduate scholarship from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. I did research in a biologically SLAM algorithm on multiple robots. The problem of solving a multi-robot SLAM is equal to solve a fairly high-dimensional problem. However, I tried to solve it with Ant Colony Optimization. </p>

<p>In the year of 2010, I joined University of Hamburg as a Marie Curie researcher as well as a full-time PhD student focusing on brain modelling and its embodiment on cognitive robotics. The main contribution of my PhD thesis is to design different types of neural architectures to model the feedback mechanism in sensorimotor cortices, all based on recurrent neural connections. These connections also facilitates the predictive function of a sensorimotor system, which are examined in various experiments involving simulated or real robots. My work was sponsored by Marie Curie ITN project "RobotDoC". </p>

<p>After my PhD project ended in 2013, I worked as a postdoc researcher at University of Hertfordshire under the supervision of Dr. Lola Canamero with ALIZ-E project. My task was to design and implement neural models for learning personalized emotion from a Kinect sensor. </p>

<p>In the year 2015, after I passed my PhD defence in Hamburg, I am currently working at the CRNS of Plymouth University with project "POETICON++". My job is to develop action-learning neural architecture based on MTRNN model.

							<h3>Bio-inspired Particle Filter and its SLAM application </h3>
							<p>The utilization of multi-robot systems has a major advantage when comparing to single robot systems, for example, with multiple robots working together, it has the potential to accomplish a task faster than a single robot. However, when a team of robots is sharing the same worksite, the Simultaneously Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem becomes much more difficult to resolve because a huge amount of information is needed to be processed as well as analyzed. But on the other hand, multi-robot SLAM can be more efficient if robots can exchange and share information regarding their sensed data properly. In the SLAM problem, especially for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), it is necessary to include non-linear and non-Gaussian parameters, for which the traditional Kalman Filter (KF) cannot yield ideal solution. In applications involving non-linear and non-Gaussian parameters, Particle Filters (PF), which are based on the concept of Monte Carlo simulation, are more suitable estimation techniques. However, in problems involving multiple dimensions, such as the multi-robot SLAM problem, when a huge number of particles are being used, two problems, namely particle impoverishment and sample size dependency, will occur during the particle updating stage and these problems will become more severe. The problems will reduce the accuracy of the estimation results and resampling algorithms, such as Sequential Importance Sampling, Stratified Resampling and Systematic Resampling are used to alleviate these two problems. </p>

<p>In my master thesis, a novel PF algorithm for tackling the particle impoverishment and sample size dependency problems is being studied and its application in a multi-robot system is examined. In this algorithm, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is incorporated into the generic particle filter in order to drive the proposal distribution to approximate the optimal solution. Mathematical proof and results obtained from a single variable estimation problem as well as from the robot localization problem show that, after the ACO optimization, better proposal distribution and more accurate estimation results can be obtained. In order to evaluate the performance of the ACO improved PF (PFACO) when applied to non-linear and non-Gaussian problems, such as the localization and SLAM problem, studies were conducted and utilization of PFACO algorithm for multi-robot systems was introduced. In a multi-robot environment, when two robots encounter, the same information on the same estimation problem represented by the two sets of particles will be re-evaluated based on information conveyed by particles from different sets. The particles are then merged into a single set and in such cases, parallel computing can be applied in order to reduce the processing time. By software simulation, our results are better than those from traditional approaches both in estimation error and execution time. </p>

							<h3>Artificial Neural Models for Feedback
Pathways for Sensorimotor
Integration
</h3>
							<p>The brain comprises hierarchical modules on various physiological levels. Neural
feedback signals (including lateral and top-down connections) modulate the neural
activities via inhibitory or excitatory connections within/between these levels.
They have predictive and filtering functions on the neuronal population coding of
the bottom-up sensory-driven signals in the perception-action system.
<p>In this thesis, we propose that the predictive role of the feedback pathways at most
levels of action and perception can be modelled by the recurrent connections in
different artificial cognitive platforms (simulation and humanoid robots). This will
be examined by three recurrent neural network models. Furthermore, the three
models and experiments with them show that the recurrent neural networks are
able to model feedback pathways and to exhibit the feedback-related sensorimotor
predictive functions.
<p>In the first model, inspired by the study of neurobiology, we emphasize that the
feedback connections facilitate a predictive mechanism to compensate for the neu-
ral delay in the two streams (ventral and dorsal) of the visual system. We model
this with a novel recurrent network with a horizontal product. In the simula-
tion, the recurrent connections give rise to the fast- and slow-changing neural
activations in the dorsal- and ventral-like hidden layer. Particularly the recur-
rent connections build a feedback channel to predict the upcoming neural activity
in the dorsal-like hidden layer, while another feedback channel maintains stable
neural encoding in the ventral-like hidden layer.
<p>In the second part of the thesis, a sensorimotor integration model with visual
prediction is implemented, whose visual perception part is considered to be the
dorsal stream representation of the first model. This further augments the visual
prediction with its role of guiding motor action. Together with the action module
which adopts a continuous reinforcement learning algorithm, this model allows a
smooth and faster docking behaviour for a humanoid robot.
<p>In the third experiment, we propose that the source of the feedback pathway could
be the high-level cognitive processes, such as pre-symbolic representations. Fur-
thermore, the emergence of these cognitive processes and feedback-related sensori-
motor functions are not independent processes but they integrate and assist each
other in a hierarchical way. Therefore, we augment the first horizontal product model with additional units, called parametric bias (PB) units, as a pre-symbolic
representation. In the robot experiments, we show that during the learning pro-
cess of observing sensorimotor primitives, the pre-symbolic representation is self-
organized in the parametric units; during prediction, these representational units
act as a prior expectation which guides the robot to recognize and to expect
various pre-learned sensorimotor primitives.
<p>These three experiments demonstrate that implementation of the feedback path-
ways with recurrent connections can realize predictive sensorimotor functions. The
emergence of these feedback pathways also accounts for the pre-symbolic represen-
tation in cognitive systems. Furthermore, we claim that the recurrent connections
can be one of possible neural structures to build up the feedback pathways on the
sensorimotor integration in artificial cognitive systems.

							<h3>Neural learning for emotion recognition</h3>
							<p>In this work, a variant version of recurrent neural network is adopted to recognize emotion from human movement.
<p>From our published paper, we showed that a trained RNNPB can successfully retrieve, recognize and generate different types human body movements based on different emotions . The parametric bias (PB) units in this recurrent network are connected to the hidden layer as ordinary bias units, but the internal values of them are also updated through back-propagation. In this application, the network recognizes which emotion arisen from the behavior sequences. After we trained it with personalized joint movement data obtained from Kinect, in the recognition experiment, the values of PB space were updated by a variant principle of back-propagation, so that it represented what kinds of emotions can be identified from this movement. </p>
