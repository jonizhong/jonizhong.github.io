<h4 class="western">(PhD theis) Artificial Recurrent Neural Models for
Feedback Pathways on Predicting Function in Sensorimotor Integration </h4>
<p><big>During my PhD I was involved in working with EU FP7-ITN PEOPLE <a href="http://www.robotdoc.org/" target="_blank">RobotDoC</a> project.
The general topic within this project is "Neural Cognition
Integration". From this aim, my PhD title is “Artificial Recurrent
Neural Models for Feedback Pathways on Predicting Function in
Sensorimotor Integration”. </big></p>
<p><big>Neural feedback modulates the low level neural activities via
inhibitory or excitatory connections. These feedback pathways exist as
neural connections within one level (lateral connections) or between
different levels (top-down connections) in the sensorimotor hierarchy.
They have a predicting and filtering function in the context of
neuronal population coding. <br />
</big><br />
</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<div style="text-align: left;">In this thesis, we propose that the
feedback pathways predict and
maintain neural activities in biological cognitive systems at each
level of the perception and action hierarchy. These activities also
perform a predictive sensorimotor integration at most levels of action
and perception. We also suggest that the top-most source of the
feedback signals may originate from prior knowledge that relates to
several cognitive processes, such as expectation, memories and other
symbolic representation. These simultaneously emerge with the
development of
sensorimotor knowledge.<br />
</div>
&nbsp;<img style="width: 70%; height: 70%;" alt="Predictive Framework" src="images/pam.PNG" /><br />
</div>
<p><big><big><br />
In terms of artificial cognitive systems, we assert that recurrent
connections are a basic structure to realise feedback, because they are
simple to be implemented and to be trained. <br />
In the thesis, we present three recurrent neural network models to
implement the predictive function in perception or/and action in
different artificial cognitive platforms (simulation and humanoid
robots). Besides, the three models and their experiments shown in this
thesis show that the recurrent neural networks are able to interpret
feedback pathways related sensorimotor predictive functions.</big></big></p>

<p><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Modelling Two Visual Streams
based on Recurrent Connections</span></big><br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><big>In the first model, we emphasise that the feedback connections
facilitate a predictive mechanism to compensate for the neural delay in
the two streams (ventral and dorsal streams) of the visual system. We
model this with a novel recurrent network with a horizontal product. In
the simulation, the recurrent connections give rise to the fast- and
slow- changing neural properties in the dorsal- and ventral-like hidden
layer. <br />
Particularly the recurrent connections build a feedback channel to
predict the upcoming neural activity in the dorsal-like layer, while
another feedback channel maintains stable neural encoding in the
ventral-like layer.&nbsp; This is comparable to the findings in
neurobiology.</big></p>
<p><big>The image below shows the activations of dorsal- and
ventral-like layers:</big><br />

<p><big style="font-weight: bold;">Modeling Visual prediction based on
Recurrent Connections and CACLA</big><br />
<br />
<big>In the second part of the thesis, a sensorimotor integration model
with
visual prediction is implemented, whose visual perception part is
considered to be the dorsal stream representation of the first model.
It further augments the visual prediction to its role of
`vision-for-action'. In the action module of this model, a continuous
reinforcement learning algorithm named Continuous Actor-Critic Learning
Automaton (CACLA) is applied. Together with the recurrent connections
based visual prediction, this model allows a smooth and faster docking
behaviour for a humanoid robot.</big></p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pre-symbolic
Emergence from Two
Visual Streams</span><br />
1. based on
Recurrent
connections<br />
we propose that the source of the feedback
pathway can be traced in the high-level cognitive processes, such as
pre-symbolic representation. Furthermore, the emergence of these
cognitive processes and feedback related sensorimotor functions are not
independent processes but they also integrate and assist each other in
a hierarchical way. Therefore, we augment the model we designed in the
first experiment with additional units, called parametric bias (PB)
units as a pre-symbolic representation. To examine this horizontal
recurrent network with parametric bias (HoRNNPB) model, we design
experiments on two robots: one robot is learning while observing the
other robot is moving objects. During the learning process of observing
sensorimotor primitives, i.e. observing a set of trajectories of arm
movements and its colour features, the pre-symbolic representation was
self-organized in the parametric units. During prediction,
these representational units acted as a prior expectation to guide the
robot to recognize and expect various pre-learned sensorimotor
primitives.<br />

2. based on Dynamic Neural Field</span><br />
Dynamic Neural Field (DNF) is essentially a
continuous
recurrent
neural network. The recurrent weights in RNN are equivalent to lateral
connections in DNF through an interaction kernel and receive external
inputs (visual stimuli). This ongoing project aims to model the same
principle of language emergence with two stream visual inputs with
another way, in which two neural fields encode the “what” and “where”
information respectively.<br />

Projects</big><br />1. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Personalized
Emotion Recognition from
Kinect Sensor</span><br />
In
this work, a variant version of recurrent neural network is adopted to
recognize emotion from human movement.<br />
From
our published paper, we showed that a trained RNNPB can successfully
retrieve, recognize and generate different types human body movements
based on different emotions . The parametric bias (PB) units in this
recurrent network are connected to the hidden layer as ordinary bias
units, but the internal values of them are also updated through
back-propagation. In this application, the network recognizes which
emotion arisen from the behavior sequences. After we trained it with
personalized joint movement data obtained from Kinect, in the
recognition experiment, the values of PB space were updated by a
variant principle of back-propagation, so that it represented what
kinds of emotions can be identified from this
movement.<br />

Modelling based on
Spiking Neural Network</span><br />
The general
behaviours of a
group of animals, such as ﬂock of
birds or a bank of ﬁshes, follow some rules which may result from
evolution or other adaptation for environment. The aim of this project
is in what circumstances they change such behaviors. The key idea in
flock of animals' behavior control is to provide sensory information
(distance between fellow animals) as stimulus. We use spiking neural
networks as one model to explain how individual decisions change the
group behaviors, in which neural spikes to control movements of the
animals and to decode the correspondant
behavior.<br />

We usually get in
touch with
different kinds of news feeds in
social networks (e.g. facebook, twitter). Some people/business tend to
analyze positive/negative emotion from the news feed the people post.
There have been various kinds of research concerning how to analyzes
sentiment from a short text. In this project, we aim to use such
techniques to make a mature product (e.g. an app). <br />

(Master Thesis) Bio-inspired
Particle
Filter
and
its SLAM application&nbsp; </span></big><br />
The utilization of multi-robot systems has a
major
advantage
when
comparing to single robot systems, for example, with multiple robots
working together, it has the potential to accomplish a task faster than
a single robot. However, when a team of robots is sharing the same
worksite, the Simultaneously Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem
becomes much more difficult to resolve because a huge amount of
information is needed to be processed as well as analyzed. But on the
other hand, multi-robot SLAM can be more efficient if robots can
exchange and share information regarding their sensed data properly. In
the SLAM problem, especially for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV)
and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), it is necessary to include
non-linear and non-Gaussian parameters, for which the traditional
Kalman Filter (KF) cannot yield ideal solution. In applications
involving non-linear and non-Gaussian parameters, Particle Filters
(PF), which are based on the concept of Monte Carlo simulation, are
more suitable estimation techniques. However, in problems involving
multiple dimensions, such as the multi-robot SLAM problem, when a huge
number of particles are being used, two problems, namely particle
impoverishment and sample size dependency, will occur during the
particle updating stage and these problems will become more severe. The
problems will reduce the accuracy of the estimation results and
resampling algorithms, such as Sequential Importance Sampling,
Stratified Resampling and Systematic Resampling are used to alleviate
these two problems. <br />
<br />
In my master thesis, a novel PF algorithm for tackling the particle
impoverishment and sample size dependency problems is being studied and
its application in a multi-robot system is examined. In this algorithm,
Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is incorporated into the generic particle
filter in order to drive the proposal distribution to approximate the
optimal solution. Mathematical proof and results obtained from a single
variable estimation problem as well as from the robot localization
problem show that, after the ACO optimization, better proposal
distribution and more accurate estimation results can be obtained. In
order to evaluate the performance of the ACO improved PF (PFACO) when
applied to non-linear and non-Gaussian problems, such as the
localization and SLAM problem, studies were conducted and utilization
of PFACO algorithm for multi-robot systems was introduced. In a
multi-robot environment, when two robots encounter, the same
information on the same estimation problem represented by the two sets
of particles will be re-evaluated based on information conveyed by
particles from different sets. The particles are then merged into a
single set and in such cases, parallel computing can be applied in
order to reduce the processing time. By software simulation, our
results are better than those from traditional approaches both in
estimation error and execution time. <br />
