<h3>
<p>My name is Junpei Zhong (traditional Chinese: 鍾俊培, simplified
Chinese:
钟俊培). I was born and grew up in the third largest city in China,
Guangzhou, locating in the southern part. In year 2002, I attended <a href="http://en.scut.edu.cn/" target = "_blank">
South China
University of Technology</a>, which is also in Guangzhou city. There I
studied
Control Science (major) and Computer Science (minor). Besides of taking
required classes, I also took part in other research projects (such as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboCup_2D_Soccer_Simulation_League" target = "_blank"> RobotCup </a>, embedded system design). I think my research interests
started since
that time. </p>
<p>At the year 2006, because I reached 10% of the overall ranking
of all the
exams, I entered Harbin Institute of Technology Shenzhen Graudate School for further study without taking
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postgraduate_Admission_Test" target="_blank">the postgraduate admission examination</a>

<p>However, in the year 2007, I got a full scholarship so I moved to <a href="http://www.polyu.edu.hk/cpa/polyu/index.php" target="_blank"> the Hong
Kong
Polytechnic University</a>. I did research in a biologically SLAM algorithm on multiple
robots.
The problem of solving a multi-robot SLAM is equal to solve a fairly
high-dimensional problem. However, I tried to solve it with
Ant Colony
Optimization.  </p>
<p>After I realised the power of a biological system and its
inspiration to
solve difficult problems, I was would really interested in the power of
brain
that is assumed to be even more powerful. Therefore I joined <a href = "www.uni-hamburg.de/" target = "_blank">University
of
Hamburg</a> as a research associate as well as a full-time PhD to do further research on brain modelling and its implementatoin on cognitive robotics.
More specifically, our part in Hamburg belongs to the "Brain Node", which focus on computational
neuroscience and its embodiment in a Cognitive Robotics system. I investigated the top-down influences on sensorimotor integration, among which can be traced as a feedback mechanism at a cognitive and neuronal levels. Since it can be regarded as a Bayesian inference, it can be modeled as recurrent connections. A few neural network architectures were designed focusing on various cognitive functions of the sensorimotor integration. This work was sponsored by <a href="http://robotdoc.org/" target="_blank" RobotDoC</a>, an EU funded Marie Curie international
training
network.</p></h3>
